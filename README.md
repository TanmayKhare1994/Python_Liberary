# Python Regular Expression 

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for various kinds of string manipulation.
They are a domain specific language (DSL) that is present as a library in most modern programming languages, not just Python.
They are useful for two main tasks:
- verifying that strings match a pattern (for instance, that a string has the format of an email address), 
- performing substitutions in a string (such as changing all American spellings to British ones).
Domain specific languages are highly specialized mini programming languages.
Regular expressions are a popular example, and SQL (for database manipulation) is another. 
Private domain-specific languages are often used for specific industrial purposes.
